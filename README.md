### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Danni! A brand new :uk: coder, embarking upon the biggest challenge of my career - a 16 week bootcamp with School of Code :school_satchel:

I will be using this to track my journey, commencing March '23 :notebook:

Please feel free to connect with me - I love meeting new people and learning from one another.
